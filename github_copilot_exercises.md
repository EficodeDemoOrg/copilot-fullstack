   - Ensure you follow the step-by-step process in the prompt: define the rule, confirm its clarity, and document it as instructed.
   - Repeat the process for additional rules (e.g., error handling, coding standards), always adhering to the prompt's review and approval steps.
   - Document the finalized rules in a markdown file or as code comments, as specified in the prompt and chatmode guide.

**Learning Goal:** Learn to use Instructor mode and prompt templates to define and enforce repository-wide rules and standards.

### Exercise 8.3: Reusable Prompts

1. **Apply Reusable Prompts According to Their Protocols**
    - Explore the `.github/prompts/` folder and, for each prompt, read its guide to understand its intended workflow and protocol.
       - For implementation tasks, use `implement-prompt.prompt.md` and follow its step-by-step instructions for generating and reviewing code changes.
       - For planning, use `create-plan.prompt.md` and strictly follow its collaborative planning protocol: ingest research, propose strategy, seek approval, break down tasks, and finalize the plan as described.
       - For session summaries, use `summarize-session.prompt.md` and follow its format for capturing key outcomes and next steps.
    - Practice saving and reusing these prompts, always adhering to their review, approval, and output formatting requirements.

2. **Thread Dump Example: Critical Context Handoff**
   - Open `.github/prompts/thread-dump.prompt.md` and review its protocol for context handoff.
   - Simulate a scenario where your chat context is at maximum capacity and you need to hand off work to a new agent instance.
   - Use the prompt to generate a final briefing message that includes:
     - Primary objective of the session
     - Mission log (completed steps, current status)
     - Essential assets (files, data, URLs)
     - Immediate directives (next actions)
     - Constraints & pitfalls (instructions, limitations)
   - Practice formatting your output as a single, precise text message (not a file or code block), following the template in the prompt.
   - Discuss how this protocol ensures seamless continuation of work and why it is important for collaborative or multi-agent workflows.

**Learning Goal:** Develop and apply reusable prompt patterns for common tasks, leveraging provided prompt files for consistency and efficiency.
